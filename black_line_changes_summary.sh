echo "🖤 BLACK LINE DETECTION - SUMMARY OF CHANGES"
echo "============================================="
echo ""
echo "✅ CHANGES MADE:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🎨 Updated Color Detection:"
echo "   - Changed from GREEN lines to BLACK lines on WHITE background"
echo "   - Updated LINE_COLOR_LOWER/UPPER parameters for black detection"
echo ""
echo "2. 🔧 Detection Method Improvements:"
echo "   - Added GRAYSCALE + THRESHOLD method (more reliable for black lines)"
echo "   - Kept HSV method as backup/alternative"
echo "   - Used THRESH_BINARY_INV to convert black->white for easier processing"
echo ""
echo "3. 📐 Cross Detection Enhancements:"
echo "   - Improved detect_camera_intersection() for black cross lines"
echo "   - Added multiple detection methods (contours + Canny edge)"
echo "   - Relaxed detection criteria to reduce missed detections"
echo "   - Added temporal smoothing to reduce false negatives"
echo ""
echo "4. 🎯 Parameter Tuning:"
echo "   - CROSS_MIN_ASPECT_RATIO: 2.0 -> 1.5 (more sensitive)"
echo "   - CROSS_MIN_WIDTH_RATIO: 0.4 -> 0.25 (detect smaller crosses)"
echo "   - CROSS_MAX_HEIGHT_RATIO: 0.8 -> 0.9 (allow taller crosses)"
echo "   - CROSS_DETECTION_ROI_Y_PERCENT: 0.50 -> 0.45 (earlier detection)"
echo "   - CROSS_DETECTION_ROI_H_PERCENT: 0.20 -> 0.30 (larger area)"
echo ""
echo "5. 🧪 Testing Tools:"
echo "   - test_black_line.py: Basic black line detection test"
echo "   - test_cross_detection_sensitivity.py: Comprehensive cross detection test"
echo "   - monitor_cross_detection.py: Real-time monitoring tool"
echo ""
echo "🔍 DETECTION METHODS USED:"
echo ""
echo "Method 1 - Grayscale Threshold (PRIMARY):"
echo "   gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)"
echo "   _, mask = cv2.threshold(gray, 60, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)"
echo ""
echo "Method 2 - HSV Range (BACKUP):"
echo "   hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)"
echo "   mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, [0,0,0], [180,255,60])"
echo ""
echo "📊 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo ""
echo "✅ Better detection of black lines on white background"
echo "✅ Reduced missed detections (false negatives)"
echo "✅ More stable cross intersection detection" 
echo "✅ Earlier detection due to expanded ROI"
echo "✅ Temporal smoothing reduces flickering"
echo ""
echo "🧪 TO TEST THE CHANGES:"

echo ""
echo "2. Cross detection sensitivity:"
echo "   python3 test_cross_detection_sensitivity.py"
echo ""
echo "3. Real-time monitoring (requires ROS):"
echo "   python3 monitor_cross_detection.py"

echo ""
echo "⚙️  FINE-TUNING PARAMETERS:"
echo ""
echo "If detection still misses some lines, try:"
echo "   - Increase threshold: 60 -> 80 (for lighter gray lines)"
echo "   - Decrease threshold: 60 -> 40 (for more sensitive detection)"
echo "   - Adjust ROI position: CROSS_DETECTION_ROI_Y_PERCENT"
echo "   - Expand detection area: CROSS_DETECTION_ROI_H_PERCENT"
echo ""
echo "If too many false positives:"
echo "   - Increase minimum area requirements"
echo "   - Tighten aspect ratio constraints"
echo "   - Add more morphological operations"
